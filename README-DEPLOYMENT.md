### 4. Environment Variables
After deployment, you'll need to set up environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to your project in Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
3. Add the following variables:
   - `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: Your backend API URL (you'll need to deploy the backend separately)

### 5. Backend Deployment Options

2. Configure the backend as serverless functions

#### Option B: Deploy Backend to Railway/Render/Heroku

## Project Structure for Vercel
The current configuration in `vercel.json` is set up to:
- Build the frontend from the `frontend/` directory
- Output static files from `frontend/dist`
- Handle client-side routing with rewrites

## Post-Deployment
1. Test the deployed frontend
2. Configure the backend API URL
3. Test the full application functionality

## Troubleshooting
- If build fails, check the build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Ensure all dependencies are listed in `package.json`
- Check that environment variables are properly set
